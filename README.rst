TODO
----

- Find a good 'project' vim script
- Fix 'K' behavior in python scripts, it should be calling pydoc -- either via
  configuring manpageview to run it, or via pydoc.vim

  - let g:manpageview_pgm_py = "pydoc" should work, in theory, but does not
    appear to in reality at the moment

- Integrate MacVim's 'fullscreen' and 'fuoptions' into shell.vim
