Included Bundles
----------------

  Notes:

  - pythoncomplete is available in git as a mirror at
    git://github.com/vim-scripts/pythoncomplete, but the version there places
    the pythoncomplete.vim file in the wrong location, so currently the
    pythoncomplete bundle is not being managed with braid, and will be updated
    manually.
  - All of the plugins I use from Peter Odding(xolox) are handled using the
    vim-scripts mirror git repositories, even though there are proper upstream
    repositories (github.com/xolox/), because the upstream repositories aren't
    laid out in a traditional vim bundle mannger.

TODO
----

- snipmate-skeleton: rather than only going by extension, try to open a
  template for the extension, and fall back to filetype.
- Determine how to make the spell checking a bit smarter.  Specifically, I'd
  like to disable all checking in regular python strings, but have checking in
  *docstrings* and in comments.  Alternatively, don't consider "%s" a spelling
  error.
- Figure out how to deal with pylint/pyflakes interactions.  The pyflakes
  plugin sets quickfix items, and it regenerates it automatically on certain
  events, which means it blows away the pylint messages from :make.  Perhaps
  we just need a way to disable/re-enable the pyflakes autocmds.

  - Additional note: :Glog conflicts with pyflakes in quickfix usage as well.

- Disable trailing whitespace and beyond textwidth highlighting for
  conque_term buffers
- Make detectindent obey 'comments' for non-C files.
- May want to try to implement the green/red bar for unit testing that exists
  in the vimrc at http://bitbucket.org/garybernhardt/dotfiles.
- Figure out why let g:manpageview_pgm_py = "pydoc" doesn't work
- Show the pyflakes error message in the cursor bubble

  - Note: the pyflakes error message uses the quickfix stuff.  There's a vim
    signs in the signs column, and to show the message in the cursor balloon
    when mousing over the sign.  Unfortunately, there are two issues:

    - balloon does not show up when mousing over the sign
    - have to manually run QuickfixsignsSet rather than it doing so
      automatically

- Fix bugs in the current python folding plugin

  - Fails with multi-line function definitions
  - Fails with nested function definitions

- To Test

  - https://github.com/mbadran/headlights

    - I tried this, but got an error (list index out of range).  Need to test
      this under gtk+ to see if it's a MacVim specific problem.
