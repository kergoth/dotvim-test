TODO
----

- Figure out how to deal with pylint/pyflakes interactions.  The pyflakes
  plugin sets quickfix items, and it regenerates it automatically on certain
  events, which means it blows away the pylint messages from :make.  Perhaps
  we just need a way to disable/re-enable the pyflakes autocmds.
- Disable trailing whitespace and beyond textwidth highlighting for
  conque_term buffers
- Make detectindent obey 'comments' for non-C files.
- Integrate MacVim's 'fullscreen' and 'fuoptions' into shell.vim
  (http://peterodding.com/code/vim/shell/)
- Show the pyflakes error message in the cursor bubble

  - Note: the pyflakes error message uses the quickfix stuff.  There's a vim
    signs in the signs column, and to show the message in the cursor balloon
    when mousing over the sign.  Unfortunately, there are two issues:

    - balloon does not show up when mousing over the sign
    - have to manually run QuickfixsignsSet rather than it doing so
      automatically

- Figure out why let g:manpageview_pgm_py = "pydoc" doesn't work

- Find a good vim script / configuration for:

  - "Project" handling
